Used to create game trainers.  Comes with a executor that will read XML files.

This is old code that worked better before Windows 7.  Now, many games use some kind of dynamic memory 
allocation and it's a lot harder to find the code you need to NOP or replace.  Still, it worked last
time I needed it to.

Code is not licensed, so it can't be distributed in any form, except by me, via this site.
